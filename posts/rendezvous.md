The assignment of this project was clear: get people together, using the Internet of Things. Clear isn't always simple though. There was no assigned target audience, and no business goals to strive for. So we had to come up with those.

In a couple of brainstorming sessions in small groups of 5 we iteratively decided on our users: backpackers. Open-minded, already up for adventure this group of people shouldn't be too hard to bring together right?

We first set off imagining what the end result of this project would be like. How would using it feel for our users? What emotions would they have while using it? To express our vision and entice our users for our application, we created a showreel.

Backpackers usually have limited access to the internet in other countries so we had to keep data transfer and client/server interaction as minimal and simple as possible, the *real* interaction was intended to be offline.
